            <p>I have a team of chefs, writers, and video professionals who love cooking and the science behind it. In
                my Pike Place Market kitchen studio we approach cooking with both deep knowledge of traditional methods

                <h3>Jimmy Dean</h3>
                <p>When I tell people I am bringing a "sausage wonton" appetizer to the party, They give me strange
                    looks and don't really understand... UNTIL I ARRIVE WITH THESE BABIES. These appetizers are always a
                    hit! I never have any leftovers, and always make as many as I can. The taste and texture of this
                    appetizer is so satisfying; crispy wontons with a soft and tangy filling. Please note, you will need
                    to drain the cooked mixture very well before filling the cups.

                <h3>Corn Cakes</h3>
                <p>I found this recipes a few years after we got married and it is still part of my regular rotation. We
                    typically omit the jalepenos because we have lots of kids, but tonight I'm putting some in the cakes
                    I make for myself because it sounds good. We typically serve with sour cream and hot sauce, per
                    preference. We call them Dinner Cakes in our house.

                <h3>Sausage Taquito</h3>
                <p>This was great. I used the hot breakfast sausage. A bit hard to keep rolled. Better to cook a few
                    tortillas at a time. They need to stay warm to roll and not crack. Very fresh corn tortillas might
                    work terrific. I reheated them in the microwave for 5 seconds each if they cooled too much.
